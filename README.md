# Python1-challenge

## It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

## Referenced multiple AI sources to modify existing code. I also Looked back at class activities on python basics. References and collaborations for helping me with the code in this project goes to: BCS tutor (Saad, Sunshine) helped with text file output, Nate Martinez helped me build the code in PyBank, Ethan Wright helped me build the code in PyPoll along with helping me finish the text file.
